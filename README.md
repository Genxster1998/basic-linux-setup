## About

- mainly for (K)ubuntu focal/groovy. hash out script sections for compatibility if other distro. 
- auto compiles&installs thanas-x86-64-kernel upon completion, based on latest modded fork of torvalds dev git.
- built with latest daily llvm-11 for now.
- every file comes with extensive instructions to make life easier in case of personalization.
- script mainly meant as an unattended script, minimal user input is needed right at the start only.
- plugin devices which require exceptional driver support when running the script for kernel support.
